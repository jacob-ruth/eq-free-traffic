# eq-free-traffic
This repository is the work of Tracy Chin, Rebecca Santorella, and Jacob Ruth, during the 2016 Summer@ICERM program.  

Files of interest:
- microsystemBifurcation.m contains code that will find the steady state of the traffic wave, not using any macrolevel variable.
- trafficBifurcation.m uses equation-free modeling with the standard deviation of the headways as the macro-variable.
- trafficDiffMapBifurcation.m uses equation-free modeling, using a variable generated by the diffusion map, after aligning the traffic wave profiles.
- trafficDiffMapBifurcation2d.m uses equation-free modeling, using a variable generated by the diffusion map, but does not align the  traffic wave profiles.  The diffusion map in this case has two significant eigencoordinates, which forms a periodic orbit.
- diffusionMap.m and runDiffMap.m will create a diffusion map and return the requested amount of eigenvectors.
